# Telecom customer churn prediction
The csv file contains the dataset that was worked upon and the jupyter notebook contains the implementation of the project. 
The main aim of the project was to build a predictive model that could predict whether a given customer is likely to stay or churn. This is useful
as it can help take measures in advance to prevent customers from unsubscribing from the service, thus allowing more customers to be retained.
